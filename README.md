#  Correlation Analysis between Iron Ore Price Cycle and Perth Residential Property Prices

# # Introduction
This study aimed to investigate the potential correlation between the iron ore price cycle and Perth's residential property prices. Several research questions were explored, including the impact of iron ore price fluctuations on the Perth residential property price weighted average index, the variation of quarterly prices over the research time period, and the potential effect of the relationship between iron ore price rise and fall on the future of the Perth property market.

# # Methodology and Data Analysis
The analysis utilized historical data from Propertyology, ABS (Australian Bureau of Statistics), and REIWA (Real Estate Institute of Western Australia). The iron ore price cycle was compared with Perth's residential property prices, including the housing price index and the number of units sold. Statistical techniques such as correlation analysis and regression modeling were employed to identify any relationships between the variables.

# # Correlation Findings
The results indicated that there is no significant correlation between the iron ore price cycle and the number of units sold in relation to time. The R-squared value of -0.3 suggests that the data did not fit the model, indicating no meaningful relationship.

However, a correlation was observed between the iron ore price and the housing price index. As the iron ore price rose and fell, there was an apparent impact on Perth's residential property prices. The data showed a positive correlation, suggesting that increases or decreases in iron ore prices were associated with corresponding movements in the housing price index.

# # Quarterly Price Variation
The analysis also examined the quarterly price variation over the research time period. Specific details regarding the magnitude and direction of these variations were not provided in the information provided.

# # Future Outlook for the Perth Property Market
The relationship between iron ore price fluctuations and the future of the Perth property market remains uncertain. While a correlation was observed between iron ore prices and the housing price index, other factors such as first home owner grants, interest rates, and housing stock turnover also played significant roles.

Propertyology emphasized that there is no direct relation between iron ore prices and property prices but acknowledged that global commodity market prices can impact both the economy and the property market. REIWA concluded that any effect on the property market would likely occur with a lag, requiring several quarters of upturn or downturn in commodities prices to filter through to the property market.

# # Conclusion
In conclusion, this study found no correlation between the iron ore price cycle and the number of units sold in Perth. However, a correlation was observed between iron ore prices and the housing price index, indicating some level of influence on residential property prices. The relationship between iron ore prices and the future of the Perth property market remains uncertain, as other factors also contribute to market dynamics. Further research and analysis are recommended to gain a deeper understanding of these complex relationships.
